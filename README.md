# Flamingo Catering

We live in an era in wich the enviroment should be one of our main concerns, and catering and event managment is not the exception. Normaly, because of the enormous work that means 
developing an event, the eco-friendly aspect is not fully considered. In fact, most of the times is ignored. In Flamingo Catering we offer more than a incredible culinary experience,
our MAIN concern is the enviroment and we are constanly looking for ways to improve our impact to it. We are the option for big companys and small privates to be able to still enjoy
from a good celebration without the concern of how is this affecting our world around.

In the site you could find our services, a gallery with fotos of our latest events, the option to see in real time the impact of the company, links to our social-media networks and 
a form page where the client can contact the catering with concerns and event ideas. The main target are green based companys that look for an event planner who can mantain 
their eco-friendly aproach.

## Features

### Header/Navigation

- The Header is fixed to the Nav-bar at the top of the page. It shows the name of the business at the left with a subtitle that explains the main purpose of it and on the right the logo that is also in the favicon element.

- The navigation has 3 main elements: Home, Gallery and Contact Us! Each one directs to a different page. Under every element there is a underline who shows in which page you are on.

- The contrast with the leaf background and the pink tones of the logo and the letters shows the "natural" aspect of the business.
